## 2.3.1

- `LyricsParser` parses any supported format, guessing it from the content so only its parser runs, plain text is rejected in a single pass (~50x faster than trying every parser)
- `SubtitleParser.isValid` no longer compiles a regex per call

## 2.3.0

- `QrcParser` reads the word synced QRC lyrics of QQ Music

## 2.2.0

- `LrcLineResolver` finds the line at a position, `forUiDisplay` takes it through `lineResolver`
- Lines with unique out of order timestamps are sorted
- `PaxsenixJsonParser` reads the word synced json of the Lyrically (paxsenix) api
- Interlude empty lines are no longer skipped after a translated line, and background vocals no longer hide their main line
- Extended lines (`M: ...`) no longer get an interlude empty line sharing their timestamp

## 2.1.0

- Parsing is ~6x faster for word synced lyrics and ~10x faster for plain synced lyrics, regexes were replaced with hand written scanners producing identical output
- The last word of a word synced line without an end timestamp now ends at the next line that starts after it, skipping translation and overlapping duet lines instead of snapping to an earlier timestamp
- The last word of the final line is no longer dropped when it has no end timestamp, it gets the line's average word duration
- Word parts of lines with multiple timestamps (`[00:10.00][01:20.00]...`) are now shifted to each timestamp
- `Lrc.forUiDisplay` now applies offset, `extraOffsetDuration` and the multiplier to word parts too, not only to line timestamps
